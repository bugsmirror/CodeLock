# **CodeLock**

**About:** 

Bugsmirror CodeLock is an automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool for mobile apps. It scans an app's code to detect 50+ security vulnerabilities like insecure code and security misconfigurations and generates a detailed SAST report within 30 minutes. Try CodeLock to ensure your app is secure from the ground up.

# **CodeLock \- Static Security Analysis**

Bugsmirror CodeLock is an automated SAST tool that detects 50+ security vulnerabilities in mobile applications by analyzing their static code, including obfuscated segments. It meticulously examines your app‚Äôs code to uncover hidden security flaws that could put your data and users at risk. Using advanced techniques, it decompiles mobile app files and scans for vulnerabilities. CodeLock tests your Android & iOS mobile applications thoroughly, revealing risks with precision.

# **Problem Statement**

* Lack of reliable testing tool to ensure continuous security.

* Lack of automated static security testing tools in the market that can test mobile apps and provide reports within 30 minutes.

* Existing tools give high false positives which can be misleading.

* Static security testing is often overlooked in case of frequent deployment.

* Maintaining confidentiality if sharing source code for testing.

# **Why is Static Security Testing Necessary?**

Static security testing is a technique that evaluates the security and functionality of mobile applications by examining its code without running an application. It focuses on identifying vulnerabilities, code quality issues, and security flaws at an early stage of development. Static testing plays a vital role in improving the reliability and security of mobile apps. By identifying vulnerabilities during the early stages of the app development, it significantly reduces the risk of security breaches and ensures robust app performance. It also helps in ensuring that the app adheres to industry best practices and standards before it is deployed.

# **Statistics of Static Security Analysis of Mobile Apps**

In our in-depth Static Security Audits of over 300 mobile applications globally, we uncovered significant insights that highlight the need for robust static testing practices:

* **65% of the applications tested had hardcoded sensitive data, including API keys and passwords, exposing them to potential exploitation.**

* **The remaining 35% of the applications were partially protected but still bypassable**.

# **Key Features of CodeLock**

CodeLock assesses mobile apps across these parameters:

1. Data Storage and Privacy  
2. Insecure Communication  
3. Security Misconfiguration  
4. Insufficient Cryptography/Code Injection  
5. Insufficient Binary Protections  
6. Insecure Data Storage  
7. Insufficient Input/Output Validation  
8. Inadequate Cryptography

# **üß† How to use CodeLock?**

1\. Contact Bugsmirror to register on the Bugsmirror MASST (Mobile Application Security Suite and Tools) portal.

2\. Login to Bugsmirror MASST portal and Go to CodeLock page.

3\. Upload an APK/IPA file of your mobile app or give its Play Store/App Store link, and submit the app.

4\. Within 30 minutes you will get a static analysis report of your app‚Äôs code that you can view and download from the portal.

# **üõ°Ô∏è Why CodeLock?**

* ‚úÖ Helps in identification of potential issues at the code level even before the app is launched.

* ‚úÖ Provides recommendation to fix security vulnerabilities during the app‚Äôs development phase and saving money, as it‚Äôs far more cost-effective than fixing vulnerabilities after deployment

* ‚úÖ Ensures that an app‚Äôs code is analyzed against coding standards, security guidelines, and best practices

* ‚úÖ Provides SAST report that contains details of the vulnerabilities found, Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs), steps of reproduction of bugs, and recommendations to fix the issues found

* ‚úÖ Prevents misuse of the code under analysis as no source code sharing required.

# **üß™ Use Cases**

CodeLock can be used to test:

* Apps involving critical data across all industries including Fintech, Healthtech, Government, etc.

* Apps requiring security risk assessment before being launched like payment apps

* Apps handling highly sensitive or personal data
